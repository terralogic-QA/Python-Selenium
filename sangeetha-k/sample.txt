Biryani is an evergreen classic that really needs no introduction
India offers so much on its culinary platter but the one dish Indians unanimously love indulging in is the mouth-watering biryani
With local and hyperlocal variations having evolved into distinctive styles of biryanis one is spoilt for options when it comes to experiencing this melting pot of flavours
Thank you.
